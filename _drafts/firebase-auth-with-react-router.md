[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is a really cool Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) similar
to the now defunct Parse. They have a great free tier that I think is quite generous. 
Firebase offers a real-time database, storage options, hosting, and many other nice 
features worth checking out. 

One such feature that is the subject of this post is Authentication. Firebase Auth allows 
you to use a bunch of different auth providers (Twitter, Google, Facebook, etc) for 
your app. It's super simple to set up if you follow the [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs).
