Firewatch is a truly wonderful experience. Rarely do games elicit any kind of an emotional
response from me, but the debut entry from Campo Santo hit me with a gut punch in the opening
moments and kept me riveted to my monitor for the ensuing four hours. 

Story and emotion.

Visuals.

Voice work.

Playtime.

Criticism.

Close.
