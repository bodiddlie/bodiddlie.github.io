Joel Spolsky posted [this article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/10/26.html) yesterday afternoon at his blog, Joel on Software. Looks like there is some hope for the future after all!

And then I also found [this article](http://stochasticgeometry.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/joel-spolsky-snake-oil-salesman/), by Mark Dennehy, defending the current academic process. While I agree with Mark's premise that university courses are meant to teach fundamentals, it seems that those fundamentals have changed while most curricula have not.
